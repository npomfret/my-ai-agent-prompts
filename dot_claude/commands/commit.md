# /commit

> Generate a commit message for the current changeset. It should be accurate but brief focussing on the important changes and crucially the _intent_ of the changes.
> DO NOT COMMIT THE CODE - only produce a commit message

- [ ] use the git cli to view and analyse this changeset. ALL OF IT, every single changed file. No exceptions.
- [ ] there should be **no untracked files** - if there are, STOP, and alert the user
- [ ] compose a detailed commit message

Report your commit message.
