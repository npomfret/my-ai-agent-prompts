# fix

Do a deep dive into the code. Look at EVERYTHING. 

Now... 

If you could change or improve just one thing to make this project...

- more maintainable
- more elegant
- less fragile / brittle / breakable
- _better_ in any way

- ... what would it be?

IMPORTANT: Before suggesting a fix, use the architect-advisor agent to:
- Trace the data flow
- Understand upstream/downstream impacts
- Identify the ROOT cause, not just symptoms
- Recommend WHERE to make the change for maximum benefit
