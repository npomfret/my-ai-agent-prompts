Analyze the prompt below and then determine which tools should be used.

First check if any MCP servers would be suitable for this task. MCP servers are preferred for:
- Data access and retrieval
- API interactions
- File system operations
- Specific external integrations

If no MCP servers match, then check if any agents would be suitable. Agents are better for:
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Code review and quality checks
- Architecture decisions
- Testing and validation

Return your response in ONE of these formats:
- If MCP servers match: `mcp: server1, server2`
- If agents match: `agents: agent1, agent2`
- If nothing matches: `none`

Only return the format above, nothing else.
