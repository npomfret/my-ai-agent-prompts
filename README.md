# my-ai-agent-prompts

For Claude Code and Gemini Cli.

I create an `AI_AGENT.md` file in the root of my project and symlink it to `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`.

```shell
ln -s AI_AGENT.md CLAUDE.MD
ln -s AI_AGENT.md GEMINI.MD
```

I try to keep the file short, and have it reference other files as and when it needs:

```AI_AGENT.md
# ðŸ›‘ MANDATORY: READ THIS FIRST - DO NOT SKIP

STOP! DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE until you have completed ALL items in this document.

## Required Pre-Work Checklist

Before making **ANY** code changes, you MUST:

- [ ] Read [engineering.md](directives/engineering.md) completely
- [ ] Read [code-style.md](directives/code-style.md) completely
- [ ] Read [logging.md](directives/logging.md) completely
- [ ] Read [testing.md](directives/testing.md) completely
- [ ] State: "I have read all directive files and understand I cannot make code changes until instructed."

## Required Confirmation

After reading all directives, you MUST explicitly state:
"I have read all directive files and understand I cannot make code changes until instructed."
  
.. now follow with project specific instructions
```

Note: _getting Claude Code to follow instructions in its `CLAUDE.md` file is not easy, you can't just expect it to honour your instructions, no matter how clear they are._ 

Also use symlinks for these files in order to add them to any project (and gitignore them).

```shell
ln -s ../my-ai-agent-prompts/directives .
ln -sf ../../../my-ai-agent-prompts/commands/analyse.md .claude/commands/
ln -sf ../../../my-ai-agent-prompts/commands/changes.md .claude/commands/
ln -sf ../../../my-ai-agent-prompts/commands/next-task.md .claude/commands/

# make sure to add these to your .gitignore
```

As a general approach, I create a `docs/tasks` directory in the root of every project.  Form here I add subdirectors, or not, as needed, and write all my bug reports, feature planning, refactorings as `.md` files.
