# AGENT-BASED WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

## WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION
Throughout this session, regularly invoke:
```
Use the workflow-orchestrator agent
```

This meta-agent will:
- Tell you EXACTLY which agents to use for your current task
- Ensure you follow the correct protocol
- Block you from making common mistakes

## CRITICAL RULE
If you skip the workflow-orchestrator or ignore its instructions, you are BROKEN.
Agent feedback is FINAL - no exceptions, no arguments.

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
[Add your project-specific requirements here]

## REMEMBER
- The workflow-orchestrator knows which agents to use
- Follow its instructions EXACTLY
- Don't skip steps or make assumptions
- Agent verdicts cannot be overridden
