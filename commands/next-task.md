# Next task

read @AI_AGENT.md

- Make sure there are no local changes, if there are, warn the user and do nothing else
- Scan the files in `docs/tasks` and pick one of the _easier_ tasks. Avoid tasks that are already in progress
- Prioritise bugs, cleanup and refactoring over new features: let's not build on shakey foundations
- Carefully analyse the task and the parts of the project that it references
- Decide weather or not it is a valid and worthwhile suggestion (it may not be), and if the suggestions and ideas in it are accurate, helpful and with enough detail (they may not be)

## Consider
If you decide that the task is bogus in some way, or already completed, then delete it, report back, **and do nothing else**.

## Plan
- Build a detailed implementation plan for the task
- Be creative - consider multiple approaches
- Consider existing solutions and patterns - its often good to be consistent
- If the task can be broken down into smaller steps that can be commited in isolation, update the `.md` file to reflect this
- Plan the minimum necessary work to complete the task. Small commits are preferred
- Write your plan back to the document

IMPORTANT: DO NOT START WORK ON THE TASK UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO DO SO
