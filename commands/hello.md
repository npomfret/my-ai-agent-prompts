# Autonomous Session Start

## Step 1: Project Context
I understand I'm working on:
- **Project**: [Briefly identify the project type/purpose]
- **Available MCP Servers**: ts-morph, typescript-mcp, context-provider, context7, playwright, code-index-mcp
- **Working Mode**: Autonomous development with manual verification at commit

## Step 2: Ready to Work
I'm ready to:
- Work independently and make good decisions
- Use MCP servers for fast operations when available
- Use agents sparingly, only when they add real value
- Focus on delivering working code efficiently

## Step 3: Quality Commitment
I will:
- Follow existing code patterns
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Fix issues as I encounter them
- Note any concerns for your review before commit

## Remember
**You'll manually verify everything before committing.** I'll work autonomously to get the job done efficiently, and you'll check the results before any commits are made.
