# Session Initialization Protocol

## Step 1: Confirm Understanding
Prove to me that you understand your instructions.

## Step 2: MANDATORY Agent Workflow Activation
After confirming understanding, you MUST immediately:

```
Use the workflow-orchestrator agent
```

The workflow-orchestrator will:
- Analyze what you're being asked to do
- Tell you EXACTLY which agents to use
- Ensure you follow the correct protocol

## Step 3: Follow Orchestrator Instructions
Whatever the workflow-orchestrator tells you to do is MANDATORY.
You are BLOCKED from proceeding until you complete its instructions.

## Why This Matters
- Skipping workflow-orchestrator = BROKEN Claude Code
- Ignoring agent protocols = INVALID output
- The orchestrator ensures quality and compliance

Remember: This is not optional. After /hello, your next action MUST be to invoke the workflow-orchestrator agent.
