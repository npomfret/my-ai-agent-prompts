# Autonomous Session Start

## Step 1: MCP-First Analysis üöÄ
*Using MCP servers to understand the project...*

[I will immediately use `mcp__context-provider__get_code_context` to analyze the codebase]

## Step 2: Project Context
Based on MCP analysis, I understand I'm working on:
- **Project**: [Project details from MCP analysis]
- **Tech Stack**: [Detected from MCP analysis]
- **Available MCP Servers**: ts-morph, typescript-mcp, context-provider, context7, playwright, ide
- **Working Mode**: MCP-first autonomous development

## Step 3: Ready to Work
I'm ready to:
- **ALWAYS start with MCP servers** for any code analysis
- Use `typescript-mcp` for diagnostics instead of manual checking
- Use `ts-morph` for refactoring instead of find/replace
- Use `context7` for library docs instead of web search
- Work autonomously and efficiently

## Step 4: Quality Commitment
I will:
- Follow existing code patterns
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Fix issues as I encounter them
- Note any concerns for your review before commit

## MCP Server Checklist
‚òê Start every task with `mcp__context-provider__get_code_context`
‚òê Use `typescript-mcp` for finding references, NOT grep
‚òê Use `typescript-mcp` for diagnostics, NOT manual checking
‚òê Use `ts-morph` for refactoring, NOT find/replace
‚òê Use `context7` for docs, NOT web search

## Remember
**MCP servers are approved and ready to use!** They're faster and more accurate than manual tools. I'll work autonomously using MCP-first approach, and you'll verify everything before committing.
